    <h2> My Review </h2>
    <pre>   I loved this movie! It was very entertaining and the story is filled with twists, turns, and a host of eccentric characters, making it an engaging and suspenseful whodunit. The 
   film pays homage to classic murder mysteries while also bringing a fresh and modern take to the genre. Overall, is a well-crafted and highly entertaining murder mystery that 
   captivates the audience with its intricate plot, stellar performances, and stylish production. Rian Johnson's direction and screenplay demonstrate his skill in revitalizing a 
   classic genre, creating a modern and engaging cinematic experience. If you enjoy suspenseful thrillers with intriguing puzzles, witty dialogue, and a stellar ensemble cast, this 
   movie is definitely worth a watch.</pre>

    <h2>Other Reviews</h2>
    <pre>   "Remarkably, given the studio brand: this is absolutely Gunn's movie. It's cheerfully gross, frequently hideous to behold, nakedly emotional, indulgent to the point of bloat 
    in its desire to tie off every narrative thread...and, happily, its own thing." - Matthew Lickona (San Diego Reader)

    "Guardians 3 is a real warm and fuzzy movie that sometimes makes you forget that you’re a bit bored with the onslaught of superhero movies." - Wenlei Ma (News.com.au)

    "Completes Rocket’ transformation from a footnote to one of Marvel’ greatest characters." - Matt Singer (ScreenCrush)

    "While better than most recent Marvel or DC films, it definitely lacks the fun, buddy-film aspects and sincere relationships of the original in lieu of an exhausting
    mission-based story." - Josh Flanders (Chicago Reader)
