    <h2> My Review </h2>
    <pre>   I loved this movie! It was very entertaining and the story is filled with twists, turns, and a host of eccentric characters, making it an engaging and suspenseful whodunit. The 
   film pays homage to classic murder mysteries while also bringing a fresh and modern take to the genre. Overall, is a well-crafted and highly entertaining murder mystery that 
   captivates the audience with its intricate plot, stellar performances, and stylish production. Rian Johnson's direction and screenplay demonstrate his skill in revitalizing a 
   classic genre, creating a modern and engaging cinematic experience. If you enjoy suspenseful thrillers with intriguing puzzles, witty dialogue, and a stellar ensemble cast, this 
   movie is definitely worth a watch.</pre>

    lavish tasting menu, along with some shocking surprise."Deadline notes, "Fiennes plays the world-class chef who sets it all up and adds some unexpected ingredients to the menu

    <h2>Other Reviews</h2>
    <pre>   "The art of the meal and the consumer’s craving for more more s’more are just two of the topics explored in a far tastier “eat the rich” offering than the overcooked Triangle 
    of Sadness." - Matt Brunson (Film Frenzy)

    "The story, penned by Will Tracy and Seth Reiss, is expertly paced, punctuated by gorgeous title cards announcing the dishes." - Audra Schroeder (The Daily Dot)

    "The film fares better as a tightly constructed exercise in horror, like a cross between the mechanized death of a Saw movie and the eat-the-rich grotesquerie of Peter Greenaway’s 
    The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover." - Scott Tobias (The Reveal)

    "Stylishly photographed by Peter Deming, The Menu becomes increasingly creepy with each new course. - David Stratton (The Australian)
