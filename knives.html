    <h2>Other Reviews</h2>
    <pre>   "Knives Out is a whole lot of fun, intended to keep the audience off-balance right up until the finish. It's a razor-sharp throwback from writer-director Rian Johnson" 
    - Brian Lowry (CNN)

    "An entertainment that's as smart, witty, stylish and exhilarating as any movie lover could wish for." - Joe Morgenstern (Wall Street Journal)

    "This modern twist on an old classic understands that the genre's formulas are fertile ground on which to hang strident critiques of privilege and class." 
    - Manuel Betancourt (Electric Literature)

    "I suspect that Johnson, an adolescent genre enthusiast to his core, has waited since age 10 to make a movie like this. His enjoyment is contagious, even for those of 
    us who don't think Knives Out quite hits its marks. - David Edelstein (New York Magazine/Vulture)
