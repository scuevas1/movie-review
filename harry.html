    <h2> My Review </h2>
    <pre>   I loved this movie! It was very entertaining and the story is filled with twists, turns, and a host of eccentric characters, making it an engaging and suspenseful whodunit. The 
   film pays homage to classic murder mysteries while also bringing a fresh and modern take to the genre. Overall, is a well-crafted and highly entertaining murder mystery that 
   captivates the audience with its intricate plot, stellar performances, and stylish production. Rian Johnson's direction and screenplay demonstrate his skill in revitalizing a 
   classic genre, creating a modern and engaging cinematic experience. If you enjoy suspenseful thrillers with intriguing puzzles, witty dialogue, and a stellar ensemble cast, this 
   movie is definitely worth a watch.</pre>

    <h2>Other Reviews</h2>
    <pre>   "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is, despite its trickery, that plainest and least surprising of artifacts: the work of art that is exactly the sum of its parts, neither 
    more nor less." - Anthony Lane (New Yorker)

    "Does a magnificent job in bringing to life the unique world of magic and fantasy that, until its mega-hyped release, existed only in the imaginations of author J.K. Rowling's 
    devoted readership." - Leigh Paatsch (Herald Sun)

    "I hear the J.K. Rowling books are great, and on the basis of this 2001 movie I'm ready to believe it." - Jonathan Rosenbaum (Chicago Reader)

    "A near-perfect commercial and cultural commodity." - Todd McCarthy (Variety)
